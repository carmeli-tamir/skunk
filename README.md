[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/carmeli-tamir/skunk.svg?token=fDEfs6sB6P1mJ2TXGVqR&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/carmeli-tamir/skunk)

## Overview

This is `protobuf-c`, a C implementation of the [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) data serialization format. It includes `libprotobuf-c`, a pure C library that implements protobuf encoding and decoding, and `protoc-c`, a code generator that converts Protocol Buffer `.proto` files to C descriptor code, based on the original `protoc`. `protobuf-c` formerly included an RPC implementation; that code has been split out into the [protobuf-c-rpc](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c-rpc) project.

`protobuf-c` was originally written by Dave Benson and maintained by him through version 0.15 but is now being maintained by a new team. Thanks, Dave!
